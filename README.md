# Graph_rag_step_by_step
Building each step of GraphRag separately. Each step can be edited and modified.

**Step # 1
Chunking of the input .txt file**

Before starting any process, we have to install or clone the microsoft graphrag repo.

`pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag.git`

or

`pip install git+https://github.com/zc277584121/graphrag.git`

This will install all the packages. Checking the compaatability of packages with each other is important. 

The next easy step is to prepare the input file. For, the sake of simplicity, the input file has to be in .txt formate. Make a parent or project dir and store the input file in sub input dir. Check `input.py` file for complete code.
